Create an S3 bucket or pick an existing one to hold your code zips.
Optional: Turn on versioning and retention (cleanup) policies on that bucket. Not required, but S3 offers them and they’re nice to have.
Create the initial version of your Lambda function. Doesn’t even have to be real code yet, just make a placeholder so you can set the configuration (memory, duration, execution role) as you like.
Create a “LambdaDeployment” function using the code below, and configure it to receive events from your S3 bucket. (Don’t forget to change YOUR_BUCKET_NAME, YOUR_CODE, and YOUR_FUNCTION_NAME to match your actual circumstances.)
